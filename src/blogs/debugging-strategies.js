# Effective Debugging Strategies for Developers

Debugging is a core skill every developer must master.

## Strategies That Work

1. **Reproduce the Bug**  
   Can you reliably recreate it? If not, solving it will be nearly impossible.

2. **Read the Stack Trace**  
   Start from the error message and trace back through the call stack.

3. **Use Logging Wisely**  
   Add strategic \`console.log()\` or use logging libraries like Winston or Pino.

4. **Rubber Duck Debugging**  
   Explain your code out loud—as if you're teaching it to a rubber duck.

5. **Check Recent Changes**  
   If something just broke, check the most recent commits or merges.

6. **Binary Search Debugging**  
   Comment out or isolate parts of the code to zero in on the problem.

The best devs aren’t those who don’t make bugs—they’re the ones who fix them fast.
