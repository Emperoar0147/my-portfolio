# Clean Code Principles Every Developer Should Know

Writing code is easy. Writing **clean, readable, and maintainable** code is an art.

## Why Clean Code Matters

- **Improves collaboration** between developers  
- **Reduces bugs** and technical debt  
- **Speeds up onboarding** for new team members

## Key Principles

1. **Meaningful Names**  
   Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.

2. **Single Responsibility**  
   Each function should do one thing and do it well.

3. **Avoid Duplication**  
   DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Reuse logic where possible.

4. **Comment When Necessary**  
   Let the code speak for itself, but clarify intent when needed.

5. **Write Tests**  
   Clean code is testable code. Unit and integration tests are essential.

> “Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.” – Robert C. Martin

Practice these principles daily, and your future self—and teammates—will thank you.
