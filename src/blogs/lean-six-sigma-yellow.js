## 💭 What Is Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt?

Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is a methodology that blends **Lean principles** (eliminating waste) with **Six Sigma tools** (reducing process variation).

The **Yellow Belt** level introduces professionals to:

- Core LSS concepts and tools  
- DMAIC framework (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)  
- The mindset for process improvement  
- Supporting roles in larger Green or Black Belt projects

## 🧠 What I Learned

### ✅ The Power of Data
Decisions should be driven by data, not assumptions. Through tools like **Pareto Charts**, **Cause-and-Effect Diagrams**, and **Process Mapping**, I learned how to identify root causes and waste.

### ✅ The DMAIC Framework
One of the most valuable takeaways was the **DMAIC** approach:
- **Define**: Clarify the problem and customer needs  
- **Measure**: Collect relevant data to understand the current process  
- **Analyze**: Identify root causes and patterns  
- **Improve**: Implement targeted, data-backed solutions  
- **Control**: Sustain improvements through monitoring  

### ✅ Team Collaboration
As a Yellow Belt, I’m equipped to **support LSS projects**, contribute to brainstorming sessions, and apply lean principles in my daily tasks—whether in operations, software, engineering, or business.
