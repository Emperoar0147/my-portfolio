# 🎓 Stanford Certification Unlocked!

I’m thrilled to share that I’ve earned a **Certificate of Achievement** in **Fundamentals of Data Science in Precision Medicine and Cloud Computing**, awarded by the **Stanford Deep Data Research Center**.

This intensive program was a deep dive into the convergence of **data science**, **precision medicine**, and **cloud computing**, with direct applications in AI-driven healthcare solutions.

## 🧠 What I Learned

The course provided invaluable insights into:

- **AI applications in biomedical research**
- **Genomic data analysis and personalization**
- **Using cloud platforms for scalable data science**
- **Ethics and impact in precision healthcare**

It was a powerful blend of theory and hands-on learning, taught by leading experts at Stanford School of Medicine.

## 🙏 Gratitude

A huge thanks to:

- **Stanford University School of Medicine**
- **Stanford Deep Data Research Center**
- **Dr. Lars Steinmetz**
- And the team at **ALX Africa** for making this possible.

This experience has expanded my horizons, both technically and professionally.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

I’m looking forward to applying these skills in real-world projects—especially in:

- AI for medical diagnostics  
- Healthcare data systems  
- Scalable cloud-powered research tools

## 🤝 Let’s Connect
