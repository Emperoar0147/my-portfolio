# Why Project Planning Matters

Project planning is the foundation of every successful project.  
Without a clear plan, teams can lose focus, budgets can balloon, and deadlines can slip.

## Key Phases of Project Planning

1. **Initiation**  
   Define scope and objectives. Identify stakeholders and success criteria.

2. **Scope & Requirements**  
   Break down deliverables, create a work breakdown structure (WBS), and gather requirements.

3. **Scheduling**  
   Develop a timeline using Gantt charts or Kanban boards. Set realistic milestones.

4. **Resource Allocation**  
   Assign team members and budget. Balance workload to avoid burnout.

5. **Risk Management**  
   Identify potential roadblocks and plan mitigation strategies.

## Tools & Techniques

- **Gantt Charts**: Visualize tasks over time.  
- **Kanban Boards**: Track work in progress (WIP) and optimize flow.  
- **Agile Sprints**: Use short iterations for flexibility and feedback.
